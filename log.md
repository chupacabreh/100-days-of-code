# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on a classifieds app I'm building with AngularJS. Worked with the directivces ng-if, ni-hide and ng-show. 

**Thoughts:** I found it particularly interesting that ng-if specifically deals with hiding content from the DOM, whereas ng-hide and ng-show hide content using CSS.
