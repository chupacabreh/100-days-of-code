# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 12, 2018 
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on a classifieds app I'm building with AngularJS. Worked with the directivces ng-if, ni-hide and ng-show. 

**Thoughts:** I found it particularly interesting that ng-if specifically deals with hiding content from the DOM, whereas ng-hide and ng-show hide content using CSS.

### Day 2: July 13, 2018 
####
**Today's Progress**: Worked on a coding challenge at leetcode and did some more work with my NG-Classifieds app

**Thoughts:** I'm a bit rusty at solving coding challenges so it took me a while to get this figured out. I just used a couple of for loops.

### Day 3: July 14, 2018 
####
**Today's Progress**: Created a factory for $http requests in order to access Data more easily throughout my NG-Classifieds app

**Thoughts:** factories seem to make data access a bit more easy for app building.

### Day 4: July 15, 2018 
####
**Today's Progress**: Created and styled a sidenav for my ng-classifieds app. Styled with angular-material and added open and close functionality with built in services. 

**Thoughts:** material makes things much easier!
